Android App Dev

## Getting Started

The app is my first project in flutter/dart programming.

To get started, create an API token from IEX Cloud and newsapi.org and use it in finance_object as <apiKey> and news_object as <apiKey>

if you want the stocks to be saved on AppClose, you'll have to clone https://github.com/CarlosBeilstein/backendApp and change
    CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS in /backendServer/settings.py to your local host or IP address including the port that you're using on your browser
    <username> in /backendApp/views.py to your own desired username
